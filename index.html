            <!-- About me-->
            <p>I love to design and creating new things. I am a life long learner who is seeking my bacholors in
                computer
                science with focus on software engineering. I am looking forward to future projects both of my own
                and
                colaborating on larger projects with other developers. I am always up for a good challenage!ðŸ˜Ž</p>

                webdesign and maybe even creating my own apps. I
                am looking forward to this new career path in tech and the lifetime of learning I will get as a full
                stack
                developer.</p>
            <p>Outside of my love of the arts, design and learning I have worn many hats in my life and have
                discovered
                many
                loves.
