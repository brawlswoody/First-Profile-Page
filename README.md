I am a softerware developer living in North Pole, Alaska.

I love to design and creating new things. I am a life long learner who is seeking my bacholors in computer science with focus on software engineering. I am looking forward to future projects both of my own and colaborating on larger projects with other developers. I am always up for a good challenage!ðŸ˜Ž

I also desire to expand my artistic talent from my years of painting and various other mediums to the webdesign and maybe even creating my own apps. I am looking forward to this new career path in tech and the lifetime of learning I will get as a full stack developer.

Outside of my love of the arts, design and learning I have worn many hats in my life and have discovered many loves.

Things I love
Time with my grand kids
Playing & training my Belgium Malinois
Traveling anywhere
Hunting,fishing,camping (anything Alaskan!)
Painting the Aurora Borealis
Evening sky with the Northern Lights
